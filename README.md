go to the folder 'examples_automatica'. Run the main scripts of the example you want to reproduce. 
These scripts are not (yet) optimized for runtime and by simply running them the runtime will be in the span of hours. 
The results can be plotted with the already computed results files. In order to do this change the only_plot variable to 1 in the main file, as indicated.
